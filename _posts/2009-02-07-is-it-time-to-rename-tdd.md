<p>Just reading a <a href="http://blog.objectmentor.com/articles/2009/02/06/on-open-letter-to-joel-spolsky-and-jeff-atwood">comment</a> on Uncle Bob's blog by a guy called Ted. </p>  <blockquote>   <p>What&#8217;s with this whole TDD/SOLID and Podcast stuff?</p>    <p>Just because you practiced TDD does not make your code clean nor high-quality.</p>    <p>Let&#8217;s face it, most TDD practitioners are &#8220;DEVELOPERS&#8221;. You are not &#8220;QA&#8221;, &#8220;TESTER&#8221;, &#8220;SDET&#8221;. What do you know about various testing techniques, testing principles, testing metrics, how to test, etc? </p>    <ol>Do our field a favor TDD-er, do the following:      <li>How We Test Software at Microsoft </li>      <li>Go to MS and apply for SDET position (or Google) </li>      <li>Read more books about Software Testing </li>      <li>Ask yourself if you wrote great TDD code or not </li>   </ol>    <p>Now for the last question, if the answer is &#8220;Yes&#8221;, then you&#8217;re a Tester. If the answer is &#8220;No&#8221;, then you&#8217;re a developer. And obviously, if you are a developer, you suck at TDD.</p>    <p>It&#8217;s just how the brain is wired or perhaps it&#8217;s in your training. Developers are almost always bad testers, vice versa.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Maybe TDD should be renamed &quot;<em>Coming up with a good design by first trying to use my code </em><strong>D</strong>riven <strong>D</strong>evelopment&quot;. There is an overwhelming amount of information regarding Test Driven Development and yet, still, STILL, people think it's about testing. </p>
