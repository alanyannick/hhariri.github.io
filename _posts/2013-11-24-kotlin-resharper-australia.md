I'll be in Australia soon for <a href="http://yowconference.com.au">YOW! Conference</a>, where in addition to giving a talk I'll be giving a workshop on Refactoring and dealing with legacy code with ReSharper, both in <a href="http://a.confui.com/public/conferences/517fce8207933939cd000001/locations/517fce8207933939cd000002/workshops/525c9b99b74943d7fc000218?framehost=http://melbourne.yowconference.com.au">Melbourne</a> and <a href="http://a.confui.com/public/conferences/517fce8207933939cd000001/locations/517fcec007933939cd00000a/workshops/52241bd3a7b56db7f1000066?framehost=http://sydney.yowconference.com.au">Sydney</a>. There's still time to sign-up!

In addition, the folks of the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Melbourne-Java-JVM-Users-Group/events/143189722/">Melbourne JUG</a> and <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Sydney-JVM-Community/events/151635142/">Sydney JUG</a> have been kind enough to host me to give a talk on Kotlin. We'll be putting Kotlin to the test and I hope to be able to answer any questions you might have, so it will be as interactive as possible.

Finally I'll also be at <a href="http://www.dddbrisbane.com">DDD Brisbane</a> where I'll be giving a talk and a Q&amp;A Panel.

Hope to catch you at one of the events. And once again, thanks to YOW organizers for making this all possible.
