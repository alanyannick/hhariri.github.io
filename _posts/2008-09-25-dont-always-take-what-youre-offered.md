<p>20 minutes left in my session on Continuous Integration. Thinking great! More than enough time to go thru a demo with my CI server. Switch over to my VM machine that I booted up in the background (unfortunately the room was not &quot;freed up&quot; by the previous speaker until 4 minutes before mine started), and get faced with this:</p>  <p><a href="http://www.hadihariri.com/blogengine/image.axd?picture=WindowsLiveWriter/Dontalwaystakewhatyoureoffered_F8F3/Crash_2.png"><img style="border-width:0;" height="177" alt="Crash" src="http://www.hadihariri.com/blogengine/image.axd?picture=WindowsLiveWriter/Dontalwaystakewhatyoureoffered_F8F3/Crash_thumb.png" width="244" border="0" /></a> </p>  <p>WTF!?#@#@~! </p>  <p>I did what any good computer user would do, reboot and hope for the best. And it worked! Imagine if I had pressed &quot;R&quot;. </p>
