<p>Only Apple could bring <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone">out a phone with such a slick design</a>, independently of the superb funcionality it comes with. Make sure you check out all the features. The sensors are pretty cool. Would love to see how much this goes for. I'd dump my S100 for this tomorrow (mind you, mine has pretty much had it right now anyway).</p>
