<p>Microsoft's published a <a href="http://visualstudiogallery.com/">new site named Visual Studio Gallery</a> that enables third-parties (and MS itself) to publish extensions for Visual Studio. Coming from Delphi, the 3rd party community has always been a strong one and has been the basis for many innovations and technologies. Anything that embraces external companies can only be a good thing for community, and for Microsoft. I think this move and support for external testing frameworks in the upcoming ASP.NET MVC CTP shows that MS is moving in the right direction. </p>
