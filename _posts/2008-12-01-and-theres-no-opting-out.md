<p>Just noticed this under one of the Build failure notification e-mails received from the TFS daemon:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>&#160;</p>    <p>- You are receiving this notification because of a subscription created by xxxx\Hadi Hariri Provided by Microsoft Visual Studio&#174; Team System 2008 &lt;<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/teamsystem/">http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/teamsystem/</a>&gt; </p> </blockquote>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>Notice there's no &quot;If you do not wish to receive future notifications please.....&quot;</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>Nope, you're screwed. Your best bet is to not break the build...or break me! </p>
