<br/>
<br/>
I'll be giving a hands-on [Kotlin Workshop](https://gotocon.com/london-2016/presentations/show_presentation.jsp?oid=7892) in London on the 12th of October as part of the [GOTO London](https://gotocon.com/london-2016/) Pre-Conference Workshops. 

If you're new to Kotlin want to get up and running in no time, then come along. 

<br/>
The good folks at Trifork are providing  a discount coupon for 100 GBP (**kotlin100**) if signing up for the workshop and/or conference.

Hope to see you there!
