<p>Over the weekend <a href="http://hadihariri.com/2012/04/07/test-setups-and-design-smells/">I blogged about a recurrent issue I encounter when looking at tests</a>, which is the encapsulation of the <em>Arrange </em>part of the <em>Arrange-Act-Assert </em>pattern in either setup methods or base classes. Although there are justified use-cases for it, the majority of times itâ€™s a sign of a code smell. </p> <p>The example I put was one of a Controller having too many dependencies, and I was asked a few times how to avoid this problem. The purpose of the blog post was not around this issue itself but around test setups. However, it is a valid question, and one that has been raised over the past months questioning the usage of IoC Containers.</p> <p>So I wonder, do you think this is a problem? If so, how many dependencies is too many? How would you avoid it? </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>
