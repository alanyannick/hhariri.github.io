John: "Have you looked at node.js?"

Kate: "No. I'm mostly still doing Java. Still maintaining the legacy system"

John: "Kate. You really need to find a new job, away from that enterprise legacy stuff."

### A few months later

James: "Hey John, how's life?"

John: "Not much. Having a blast doing some Express.js with node.js. Very cool stuff"

James: "Oh. Still doing node huh?"

John: "Yeah, why?"

James: "I've joined a Clojure shop. Very cool. Functional FTW!"

### Six months later

Kate: "John, guess what? I've finally convinced my team lead to try out node. It's pretty awesome"

John: "Meh"

Kate: "What do you mean meh? Didn't you tell me node is awesome? Aren't you doing node?"

John: "No. I'm doing Clojure now. It's so much better"


## A Parallel Universe

John: "So what have you been up to Kate?"

Kate: "Same place. Still working on Lantern"

John: "Oh, that's the software that helps doctors save time and money by analyzing patient data more easily right? Cool"

### A few months later

James: "Hey John, how's life?"

John: "Not much, still working on at the same place"

James: "Any new interesting things on the horizon?"

John: "Yeah. Might get to lead a new project that is putting a place a way to lower traffic accidents"

James: "Very cool. I'd love to participate in something that has a direct impact on people's lives"

### Six months later

Kate: "John, guess what? We've got a new opening at the new place. Want to join?"

John: "Nah. I'm happy here. But I know someone who might"

Kate: "Who?"

John: "James. He's looking for new and interesting challenges"
