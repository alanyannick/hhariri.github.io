I got one of those really nice e-mails today. I&#039;ve been awarded with the Microsoft MVP Award for 2008 in the category of C#. I&#039;d like to thank everyone that supported me, and a special thanks to Cristina Gonzalez (MVP Lead Manager for Spain and Portugal) and Alfonso Rodriguez (MSDN Spain).

Thanks!
