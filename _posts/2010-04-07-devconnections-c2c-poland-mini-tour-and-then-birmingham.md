<p>Next week some of the <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com">JetBrains</a> crew will be in Las Vegas, Nevada and from what I hear, apparently its going to be work-related (still, it’s Vegas. There’s always time to play). </p>  <p>We’re going to be at <a href="http://www.devconnections.com/shows/SP2010VS/default.asp?s=144">DevConnections</a>, where we’ll be launching <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper">ReSharper</a> 5, to coincide with the Visual Studio 2010 launch so if you are in the vicinity, come by our booth. There’s going to be a bunch of us there and you can come and meet some of the developers behind <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper">ReSharper</a>. </p>  <p>Apart from seeing the latest and greatest <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper">ReSharper</a> 5 features, you can find out about our latest product, <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/dotcover">dotCover</a>, as well as all some of the other tools we have (<a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/dottrace">dotTrace</a>, <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity">TeamCity</a>, <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/youtrack">YouTrack</a> or even <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/ruby">RubyMine</a>). You might even win some prizes! </p>  <p>I’ll also be giving a vendor session on Test Driven Development of ASP.NET MVC Applications at 5:30 pm on April 13th, where you’ll see some MSpec and of course the new features for ASP.NET MVC we have in <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper">ReSharper</a>. </p>  <p>After Vegas, I’ll be heading out to Warsaw for the <a href="http://www.communities2communities.org.pl/en/default.aspx">Communities to Communities Conference</a>, where I’ll have a talk on (yep, you guessed it) Architecting ASP.NET MVC Applications and then from there, on to a mini-tour of User Groups in Poland with <a href="http://twitter.com/the_undutchable">The Undutchable</a> and others. I was meant to go to Wroclaw, Krakowice and Krakow, but unfortunately I can only do Wroclaw. So the mini-tour has become a very mini tour for me. And what’s worse, I’ll miss some home-made Barszcz. Sorry <a href="http://twitter.com/kkozmic">Krzysztof</a> :(.</p>  <p>Week after that I’ll be at the <a href="http://www.vbug.co.uk/Conference/2009/VBUG-4Thought-Spring-Conference.aspx">VBUG4Though conference</a> in Birmingham. </p>  <p>And remember, if you’re in Vegas and you run into me after&#160; 9 pm, I might not sound too coherent. </p>  <p>Actually make that 9 am. </p>
