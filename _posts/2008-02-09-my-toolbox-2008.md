<p>During my talks, people normally ask me about specific tools they see on my system. About a year ago I <a href="http://#">posted about a bunch of things</a> I use. It's time I update it to the year 2008. Some have dropped off the list. There are also a few I realized I had left out that I've been using for years (some I left for an alternative solution and came back to later). So anyway here's the list:</p>  <p>1. <a href="http://#">Launchy</a>. It's Vista's Start menu search done right. It's amazing. Must-have. And if you can, make a donation to the guy developing it.</p>  <p>2. <a href="http://desktop.google.com">Google Desktop</a>. Still there. Still finding my stuff.</p>  <p>3. <a href="http://www.scootersoftware.com">Beyond Compare</a>. Nothing &quot;compares&quot; to it. Ok, bad joke, amazing tool. </p>  <p>4. <a href="http://www.textpad.com">TextPad</a>. Was using it before. Switched to Notepad2, then to ConText, now back to TextPad. The Find in Files feature it has cannot be beaten.</p>  <p>5.<a href="http://www.techsmith.com">SnagIt</a>. Still there. One complaint. It's become a little feature-bloated.</p>  <p>6. <a href="http://www.finalbuilder.com">Finalbuilder</a>. Since the first beta!</p>  <p>7. <a href="http://#">TinyClip</a>. Eat your own dog food I say.</p>  <p>8. <a href="http://#">Console</a>. Throw cmd out the window.</p>  <p>9. <a href="http://www.truecrypt.org">TrueCrypt</a>. If you own a laptop and travel or have a desktop and carry it around, or for that matter, even if you don't, you have to keep your info safe. Been using it for years, no problem.</p>  <p>10. <a href="http://keepass.com/">KeePass</a>. In combination with TrueCrypt, try getting to know my passwords! I don't even know half of them myself. Keepass types them in for me</p>  <p>11. <a href="http://www.acronis.com/">Acronis TrueImage</a>. Only way to make decent backups and not worry about open files. And it works. I've restored many times from it.</p>  <p>12. <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com">Resharper</a>. Cannot work with Visual Studio without it. It's just so unproductive to do so. </p>  <p>13. <a href="http://tinyurl.com/2x3w6w">TortoiseSVN</a>. I hated explorer-based VCS's initially but now I love the fact of not having to start an app to checkin/out a file.</p>  <p>14. <a href="http://www.foxitsoftware.com/pdf/rd_intro.php">FoxIT reader</a>. Dumped Adobe a long time ago for this lightweight alternative. Only issue, it doesn't&#160; register the correct MIME type with browsers (or maybe it's something else, haven't investigated that much) and some stupid web sites, for example <a href="http://www.iberia.com">www.iberia.com</a> try to be smart and won't issue your boarding card if they think you don't have a PDF reader installed (maybe it's just Iberia looking for Adobe specifically?)</p>  <p>15. <a href="http://#">TaskSwitchXP</a>. You don't need Aero with this.</p>
