Yegor (<a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity">TeamCity</a>), Maxim (<a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/youtrack">YouTrack</a>) and myself will be there for the entire week (August 8th-12th), showing some of the new features in our tools, as well as having a chance to interact with our users, which is one of the greatest things when attending conferences, talking to you and receiving your feedback.&nbsp; </p> <p>Similar to all recent events, we are also using the opportunity to spend some time with customers on their premises, so if you are in and around Salt Lake City, be sure to let <a href="mailto:hadi at jetbrains dot com">me know</a> as soon as possible, if you are interested. </p> <p><a href="http://nerddinner.com/4822"><img style="background-image:none;padding-left:0;padding-right:0;display:inline;float:right;padding-top:0;border-width:0;margin:10px 0 0 15px;" title="image" border="0" alt="image" align="right" src="http://hhariri.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/image1.png" width="139" height="57"></a></p> <p>Finally, Daren Knopp has also been kind enough to set up a Nerd Dinner for Thursday August 11th seeing so many nerds are in town. <a href="http://nerddinner.com/4822">RSVP here</a>. </p>
