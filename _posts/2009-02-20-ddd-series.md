<p>
If you&#039;re interested in Domain Driven Design, make sure you follow <a href="http://devlicio.us/blogs/casey/archive/tags/DDD/default.aspx">Casey&#039;s series</a> on the subject. He does a very good job of explaining things clearly and answers many obvious questions that one initially asks when starting with DDD. Make sure you check out the comments also.
