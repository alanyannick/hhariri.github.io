<p>&#160;</p>  <p>Last week I was invited to join <a href="http://devlicio.us">devlcio.us</a>, part of <a href="http://codebetter.com">codebetter.com</a> blog network. Unfortunately with all the travelling I’ve not had a chance to even do my first blog post or thank both <a href="http://devlicio.us/blogs/casey/">Jak</a> and Brendan for the invitation, and seeing I’m currently stuck at Franfurt Airport on a 5 hour layover, it’s a better time than any.</p>  <p>I’ll still be blogging on my <a href="http://hadihariri.com">regular</a> <a href="http://blogs.imeta.co.uk/hhariri">sites</a>, and as always, any non-technical off-topic posts will remain exclusively on <a href="http://hadihariri.com">my own site</a>. </p>
