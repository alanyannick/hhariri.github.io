## 7 years ago

Agile Coach:

    "The Agile Manifest talks about...."

    "So remember, amongst other things, it's about interactions, it's about being able to respond to change, focusing on value...."

(*A day after the training*)

James: "Really excited about this Agile stuff!"
Jane: "Yeah! I think it can drastically change the way we work"

## 3 weeks Later

Scrum Master: "Exciting news everyone: I have branded magnets for our new Agile board!"

## 8 months later

Agile Coach: "So how are things going?"

Scrum Master: "Not sure. I mean we're doing the whole stand-ups. We've got our scrum meetings, retrospectives, etc., but..."

Agile Coach: "But what?"

Scrum Master: "Dunno. Code Quality is just not there and it just doesn't seem that we're iterating with customers enough"

Agile Coach: "Hmmm. Looking at this project, I don't see much increase in terms of testing. Where's the CI server?"

Scrum Master: "Well, we thought we could start with the other aspects of Agile, and then focus on adding all the code related stuff later once we've got these things in place."
