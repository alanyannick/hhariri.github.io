<p>Well Marco's probably been the first <a href="http://blog.marcocantu.com/blog/nick_announces_delphi_prism.html">one to blog about it</a>. My only comments are:</p>  <p>a) Change the name. <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/CompositeWPF">PRISM</a> is already a pretty well-known project in the Microsoft camp, also known as Composite Application Library for WPF/Silverlight</p>  <p>b) Two years ago I said at a session at TechEd that going down the VCL.NET route is a mistake because of the lack of roadmap and support from third-parties. I <a href="http://www.itwriting.com/blog/date/2006/11/09">received a lot of feedback</a> (i.e. read hate mail). Ironic...</p>
