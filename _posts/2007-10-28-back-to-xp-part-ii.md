<p>I feel liberated. I've moved back to XP and I'm a happy camper. Although I virtually pulled an all-nighter, which turned out even longer since the clock went back due to daylight saving, it was worth it. </p>  <p>I tried Vista with the first betas and the then RC's. I eventually installed it on my Fujitsu that shipped natively with XPSP2. I hated it. Gave me a lot of problems. I then purchased a new laptop that shipped with Vista Home Premium. I upgraded&#160; it to Ultimate (only thing I needed that home didn't come with was Remote Desktop). I still had a lot of problems, despite being a laptop &quot;designed for Vista&quot;. </p>  <p>I've now moved back to XP and it runs SO MUCH FASTER, despite having the same setup, all the same startups, applications etc. And to be honest, I don't miss anything about Vista so far.&#160; Aero I never used so I'm not going to miss it at all. The only thing I did like was the fast search for starting apps, but <a href="http://#">Launchy</a> replaced that. UAC is a relief to be without! And for search, nothing beats Google Desktop. </p>  <p>So unless something drastic happens I hopefully will be staying on XP for a long time. </p>  <p>A OS that has a 6GB footprint just on install...something is seriously wrong with it. </p>
