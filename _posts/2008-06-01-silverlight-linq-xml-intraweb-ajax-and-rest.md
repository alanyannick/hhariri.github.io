<p>I&#039;ve updated the support for Silverlight in Intraweb to support the changes for the Silverlight 2 beta that has recently come out. To test the new functionality, I decided to put together a demo that shows how to not only use Silverlight controls, but to also interact with them using Intraweb. I then decided to take it one step further and use Intraweb as a service to provide data to the silverlight control. </p>  <p>Here I had two options: use Intraweb as a SOAP server, something that can be done very easily using Arcana&#039;s Elite Suite (now open source and available <a href="http://code.google.com/p/iwelite/">here</a>) or use REST. I decided to choose SOAP so that I could show how easy it is. Unfortunately it didn&#039;t work. Not because Intraweb failed, nor did Arcana&#039;s components, but Silverlight did. It turns out that Silverlight has <a href="http://silverlight.net/forums/p/10893/48939.aspx">issues with certain web services</a>. </p>  <p>So I had to opt for using REST, which in fact is good because it shows the simplicity and beauty of this architecture, where we get rid of the SOAP overhead. With   <br />Intraweb, implementing a REST service is extremely simple. All that is required is to process the information in the OnBeforeDispatch and set the Handled property to True.</p>  <p>Since this is quite long (not that it&#039;s complicated, but I want to explain things with as much detail as I can), I&#039;ve divided it up into several posts:</p>  <p>[Note: Integrating Intraweb and Silverlight is not complicated. The purpose of this demo is to show pretty much all the different things you can do and make use of a variety of technologies and techniques]</p>  <p>1. <a href="http://#">Creating the REST Intraweb Server</a></p>  <p>2. <a href="http://#">Consuming Data from Silverlight </a></p>  <p>3. <a href="http://#">Talking to Intraweb Controls from Silverlight</a></p>  <p>4. <a href="http://#">Talking to Silverlight Controls from Intraweb using Ajax</a></p>  <p>The final result is show below. It&#039;s not meant to be pretty, but functional and instructive. I&#039;m using the AdventureWorks database shipped with SQL Server 2005. <a href="http://#">Download code from here</a></p>  <p><a href="/blogengine/image.axd?picture=WindowsLiveWriter/SilverlightLinqXmlIntrawebAjaxandREST_A7CD/%7B%25URL.DOC.png"><img style="border-color:initial;border-style:initial;border-width:0;" src="/blogengine/image.axd?picture=WindowsLiveWriter/SilverlightLinqXmlIntrawebAjaxandREST_A7CD/%7B%25URL.DOC_thumb.png" border="0" alt=" URL.DOC" width="244" height="137" /></a></p>
