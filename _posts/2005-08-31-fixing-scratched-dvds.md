<p>I start to install Windows 2003 in a VM Machine from my MS DVD that has all the operating systems you would ever want on it, only to find I get an error reading a file. Doh! I&#039;ve been fighting for a few hours trying to enlarge a VM machine I have, with no luck, so I decided to do a fresh install, this time allocating a lot of hard drive. To my surprise, my DVD is completely destroyed. We&#039;ve had several refurbishments in our house and unfortunately my DVD&#039;s were all in the office where most of the work took (and is taking) place. Seems a few DVD&#039;s hit the floor, including the MSDN ones. Anyway, to cut a long story short, after pulling out my hair, thinking of everything that I could use to repair, I tried some &quot;T-Cut Car Scratch Remover&quot; I had. Wow! It did the job alright. Not one single error anymore. Definitely going to try it on some more DVD&#039;s I have.&nbsp; </p>
