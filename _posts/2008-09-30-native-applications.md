<p>I was just reading on a blog a reference to <a href="http://www.ddj.com/architect/210604499">an article Michael Swindell</a> published about native application development. It&#039;s fair to say that you don&#039;t always have to agree with everything someone writes, but I think in this particular case, there is misleading information. </p>  <p>The story of the .NET framework lagging behind native performance just doesn&#039;t cut it anymore. Wake up and smell the coffee. We are three versions into the .NET framework and Microsoft is already talking about 4.0. While we are seeing new things that will make applications and architectures more flexible and easier to maintain (such as dynamic binding), Delphi developers are still complaining about the garbage collector. </p>  <p>This might come as a shock to you, but in a business application, your end customer is not going to know how long it took him to destroy that order object, or to create it for that matter. He cares about his application. He cares about interoperability. He cares about his ROI. With all that the .NET Framework (or Java for that matter) has to offer in terms of productivity to the programmer, with all the frameworks that exists to make application development easier to maintain, the native vs interpreted performance argument doesn&#039;t stand anymore. </p>  <p>I&#039;m not saying that native is bad, far from it. Right now, and for the foreseeable future, there is a place for native code, just as the article points out, something needs to be under that virtual machine or the RIA. Until all computer systems (excluding my mother, she&#039;s already on .NET 3.5) have the .NET framework installed, there will be room for small utilities to run natively. But enterprise level or businesses do not have an issue with making use of applications that use the .NET framework. They don&#039;t have an issue with deployment. You can still automate and accomplish easy deployment with .NET (and I&#039;m not even talking about ClickOnce). </p>  <p>Every day we have faster processors coming out, we have cheaper memory and yet 6 years after the release of .NET we are still clinging on how native out-performs managed. They say you shouldn&#039;t dismiss something without having really tried it. Unfortunately that&#039;s something I see a lot in the Delphi community. </p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>
