Well <a href="http://codemash.org">CodeMash</a> of course, which takes place from the 12th to the 14th of January. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>JetBrains is not only Adamantium sponsor, but will also be there! We will have a booth and a vendor session where we’ll show some of the upcoming features in <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper">ReSharper</a> 6 as well as some of our other tools. </p> <p>I’d love to say that if you’ve not signed up to CodeMash, make sure you do, but it would be useless. They sold out on the 3rd day! So if you’re one of the lucky ones that has a ticket, please stop by and say hello!&nbsp; </p> <p>Our vendor Session will be on <strong>Thursday from 3 pm</strong>. I’ll also be doing a session on CouchDB on <strong>Thursday at </strong><strong>4:50 pm</strong>. </p> <p>This is the first of a series of great events planned for 2011, so stay tuned!</p> <p>Happy New Year! </p>
