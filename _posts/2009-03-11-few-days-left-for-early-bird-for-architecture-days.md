<p>Just a few days left for the Early Bird fee for the iMeta Architecture Days. It's going to be a two day event in Madrid on Design Principles, Testing, and on the second day Domain Driven Design and SOA with <a href="http://www.udidahan.com/">Udi Dahan</a>! </p>  <p>Since it's a training event, it's going to be a small group so there's more room for interaction.&#160; And all this is for just a mere 375 Euros. Price includes lunch and munchies on both days.</p>  <p>To sign up and more info, <a href="http://apps.imeta.com/events/Home/EventDetails/1">click here</a></p>
