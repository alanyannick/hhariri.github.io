We are extremely happy to announce the release of the new ReSharper: please <strong><a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/download/?dotnetblog">download ReSharper 6</a> right now.</strong>

With this new release, we have gone way and beyond merely providing new features. We have added support for not one but three new languages: <strong>JavaScript, CSS and HTML</strong>, plus <strong>ASP.NET MVC 3 Razor</strong> view engine, making ReSharper 6 and Visual Studio one of the best environments today for developing web applications. In addition we also have implemented <strong>code analysis for Visual Basic .NET</strong>.

The features however aren't limited to just new language support. Earlier in the year, we announced our new <strong>decompiler</strong>, which is built in to the core of ReSharper 6, providing integrated decompiling inside Visual Studio. Built on the philosophy of external sources, ReSharper 6 facilitates navigation of source code, whether it belongs to our solution, the .NET framework or any third party library. We also announced the availability of a new <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/decompiler/?dotnetblog">free standalone decompiler tool</a>, which is currently in Early Access Program.

ReSharper 6 also <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/whatsnew/?dotnetblog">provides a wealth of rich features for all language lovers</a>. From new<strong> in-place refactorings</strong>, to <strong>enhancements in navigation and unit testing</strong>, <strong>new code transformations</strong>, <strong>code inspections for C#</strong>, <strong>improved XAML support</strong>, ReSharper 6 provides something for everyone.

If you prefer watching over reading about the new features, <a href="http://tv.jetbrains.net/videocontent/whats-new-in-resharper-6">here's a fresh screencast for you</a>.

Also, we have previously <a href="http://blogs.jetbrains.com/dotnet/tag/ReSharper-6/">blogged about some of the new features</a> of ReSharper 6, and we'll be keep doing that after release.

We have also opened our Early Access Program for <a href="http://confluence.jetbrains.net/display/DCVR/dotCover+Early+Access+Program">dotCover 1.1.1</a> and <a href="http://confluence.jetbrains.net/display/NetProf/dotTrace+4.5.1+Nightly+Builds">dotTrace Performance 4.5.1</a> which are compatible with ReSharper 6.

We truly hope you enjoy this new release and know that we have already started working on the next version. As always, we'd love to hear your feedback.
