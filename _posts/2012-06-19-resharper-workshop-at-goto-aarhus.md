<p>This October, we will be holding a <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper">ReSharper</a> hands-on workshop as part of the <a href="http://gotocon.com/aarhus-2012/">GOTO Aarhus conference</a>, organized by our partners <a href="http://www.trifork.com/">Trifork</a>.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; </p> <p>The workshop is focused for developers that are already familiar with ReSharper. We will take a look at how to use ReSharper effectively to its full potential, covering some of the less known features as well as understanding how to customize things to suit different needs. But we won’t stop there. A good portion of the workshop will be dedicated to extending ReSharper by writing your own plug-ins. You’ll see how to leverage our platform to have deep insight into code, gain access to analysis and refactoring calls and easily extend your favorite tool with custom functionality.</p> <p>&nbsp; </p> <p>In addition to this workshop, I’ll also be offering another workshop on Web Development with Express.js, a Sinatra-inspired web framework for node.js. You’ll not only learn about Express.js and node.js, but also how to effectively use <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm">WebStorm</a>, our JavaScript and HTML IDE.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; </p> <p>The conference itself is one of the largest in Denmark and hosts a variety of tracks ranging from specific technology and languages, to process and human interactions, providing a rich and excellent choice of topics.</p> <p>For more information about the workshops:</p> <ul> <li><a href="http://gotocon.com/aarhus-2012/presentations/show_presentation.jsp?oid=3964">ReSharper</a> – 4th October  <li><a href="http://gotocon.com/aarhus-2012/presentations/show_presentation.jsp?oid=3965">Express.js</a> – 5th October</li></ul> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h3>Registration and Promotional Discount</h3> <p>In collaboration with Trifork, we are offering a 100 Euros discount off of the registration price.
