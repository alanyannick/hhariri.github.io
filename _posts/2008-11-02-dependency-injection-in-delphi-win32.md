<p><a href="http://barrkel.blogspot.com">Barry Kelly</a> (who btw, looks nothing like his photo in real life) has made a <a href="http://barrkel.blogspot.com/2008/11/reference-counted-pointers-revisited.html">nice post</a> about how to have &quot;managed&quot; pointers in Delphi Win32. This makes dependency injection so much more easier, not having to worry about freeing objects. The only thing lacking is an IoC Container now! </p>
