<p>&#160;</p>  <p>Busy week for me this week. Between meetings, coding and real bad case of migraine, I've hardly had time to catch up with blogs or investigate new things. However, I did find a bit of time to look at two new tools, one of them being <a href="http://www.balsamiq.com/">Balsamiq</a> (the other tool, another blog post). I'd heard about <a href="http://www.balsamiq.com/">Balsamiq</a> some time ago but never really got round to playing with it until this week. And all I can see is that it's damn awesome. </p>  <p>What is it? It's a tool to do mock-ups of UI's. What makes it awesome (apart from the really low price tag), is that it's extremely easy to use and powerful at the same time. Take a look at some screen mock-ups</p>  <p><a href="http://hadihariri.com/blogengine/image.axd?picture=WindowsLiveWriter/Balsamiq.Wow_ED09/image_8.png"><img style="border-width:0;" height="367" alt="image" src="http://hadihariri.com/blogengine/image.axd?picture=WindowsLiveWriter/Balsamiq.Wow_ED09/image_thumb_3.png" width="630" border="0" /></a> </p>  <p>And here's the iPhone version of the &quot;application&quot;</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p><a href="http://hadihariri.com/blogengine/image.axd?picture=WindowsLiveWriter/Balsamiq.Wow_ED09/image_4.png"><img style="border-width:0;" height="396" alt="image" src="http://hadihariri.com/blogengine/image.axd?picture=WindowsLiveWriter/Balsamiq.Wow_ED09/image_thumb_1.png" width="235" border="0" /></a>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <a href="http://hadihariri.com/blogengine/image.axd?picture=WindowsLiveWriter/Balsamiq.Wow_ED09/image_6.png"><img style="border-width:0;" height="292" alt="image" src="http://hadihariri.com/blogengine/image.axd?picture=WindowsLiveWriter/Balsamiq.Wow_ED09/image_thumb_2.png" width="495" border="0" /></a> </p>  <p>So in 5 minutes (literally), I threw up a few mock-ups of some UI that I can then show the customer. The cool thing is that it's so easy to use, you can actually have meetings with the customer using Balsamiq and come up with a design together. Here's an image of the the surface design with some random controls:</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p><a href="http://hadihariri.com/blogengine/image.axd?picture=WindowsLiveWriter/Balsamiq.Wow_ED09/image_10.png"><img style="border-width:0;" height="401" alt="image" src="http://hadihariri.com/blogengine/image.axd?picture=WindowsLiveWriter/Balsamiq.Wow_ED09/image_thumb_4.png" width="590" border="0" /></a> </p>  <p>I remember when I was doing mock-ups years ago using RAD tools like Delphi / Visual Studio. Man does this save time.</p>  <p>Love it! Definitely it's on my must-have-tools list. If you do any type of UI mock-ups, I highly recommend it. </p>
