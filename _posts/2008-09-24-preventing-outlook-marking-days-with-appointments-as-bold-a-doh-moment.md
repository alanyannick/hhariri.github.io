<p>I was setting up a recurring appointment today in Outlook that has &quot;no end&quot;. I hate recurring appointments that are more than once a month because when I look at the thumbnail of the month calendar it shows many days in bold. Sometimes the appointment doesn't justify that. I just realized that if I mark the event <strong>Show As </strong>&quot;Free&quot;, I don't get the &quot;boldiness&quot; </p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p><a href="http://www.hadihariri.com/blogengine/image.axd?picture=WindowsLiveWriter/PreventingOutlookmarkingdayswithappointm_B2DB/image_2.png"><img style="border-right:0;border-top:0;border-left:0;border-bottom:0;" height="100" alt="image" src="http://www.hadihariri.com/blogengine/image.axd?picture=WindowsLiveWriter/PreventingOutlookmarkingdayswithappointm_B2DB/image_thumb.png" width="244" border="0" /></a> </p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>I've been using Outlook for many years now. Boy do I feel stupid! I think this post deserves a new category/tag</p>
