<p>I've uploaded the presentation and demos for the VAN <a href="http://altnet-hispano.pbworks.com/">Alt.Net Hispano</a> last night. I'd like to thank <a href="http://www.gambasoft.net/">Jorge</a> and <a href="http://oberdata.com.ar/">Fabián</a> for organizing the event. And to <a href="http://www.zachariahyoung.com/">Zachariah Young</a> for access to the Live Meeting account. I thoroughly enjoyed it and it was great to see so much participation from everyone, despite going on for over 2'30 hours.</p> <p>You can download the material from <a href="http://hadihariri.com/Downloads/VirtualAltNetMVC.zip">here</a>, and from what I'm told it will be available on the Alt.Net Hispano web site also.</p> <p>You can download the <a href="http://www.viddler.com/explore/fabianober/videos/1/">video from here</a></p>
