<p>Just a quick note to say that I’ve transferred the YouTrackSharp project from my own account over to the <a href="http://github.com/JetBrains">JetBrains account on github</a>. I’ve also pushed the initial spike of <a href="http://github.com/JetBrains/YouTrackForReSharper">YouTrackForReSharper</a> which is a plug-in for <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper">ReSharper</a> to talk to YouTrack. We’re looking for contributors for this project, so if you’re up to it, fork away!</p>
