## A conversation on Twitter

## A different conversation on Twitter

<img src="{{ site.images }}/customer-support-2.png" alt="Joe Smith" style="width:60%;height=60%">

<img src="{{ site.images }}/customer-support-6.png" alt="CloudsAndAll" style="width:60%;height=60%">

<img src="{{ site.images }}/customer-support-1.png" alt="Joe Smith" style="width:60%;height=60%">


## Ways in which the second conversation can develop

1. It's solved

2. It ends up as a support ticket

While it might seem that the second conversation is merely just adding an extra step to having directed the customer to support in the first place, it is not. There is a subtle but
important difference:

1. In the first conversation the customer is hearing that you're too busy to deal with their issues.

2. In the latter, you're telling the customer that you're listening and their issues are important to you.

While it might also seem more efficient (and probably is) to create a support ticket, and have the customer send their details so that you can investigate any potential issues
more appropriately, there's a difference:

1. In the first conversation, you're telling the customer that you have the appropriate channels in place and they should follow them, no matter what.

2. In the latter, you're telling the customer that you're listening and their issues are important to you.

Enable your customers.
