<p>I'll be doing a <a href="http://www.visug.be/Default.aspx">talk in Belgium next month at the Visual Studio User Group</a>, where I'll be covering topics such as Separation of Concerns, Single Responsibility, Interface Segregation, Dependency Injection and Inversion of Control, along with examples of IoC containers. There's limited space (90) and already 55 signed up, so if you're in or around the neighbourhood, got nothing better to do than here my brag, come along. I think they are organizing a geek dinner afterwards so it should be fun. Although the talk will be in C#, the important things to grasp are the concepts, not the language, be it Visual Basic, Delphi or whatever else (obviously it needs to be a OO language).</p>
