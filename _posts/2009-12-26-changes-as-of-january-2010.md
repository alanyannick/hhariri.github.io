It&rsquo;s with a bittersweet feeling that I write this post. As of January, I will no longer be with <a href="http://www.imeta.co.uk">iMeta Technologies</a>. During my time there, I&rsquo;ve been involved in some awesome projects, had the privilege of working with some very smart and talented people, and made some great friends. I wish them all the best success in the future.
</p>

<p>
As of January, I&#039;m starting a new job. I&rsquo;m going to go back to working from home, something I did for 8 years prior to joining iMeta, so for me it feels like home (pun intended). I have to admit that as much as I liked the office buzz and enjoyed every minute of working with <a href="http://blogs.imeta.co.uk/sstrong/Default.aspx">Steve</a> and his eternal ramblings on <a href="http://blogs.imeta.co.uk/sstrong/archive/2009/12/16/823.aspx">expression trees</a>, I am happy to not have to face morning and afternoon commutes.
</p>

<p>
So what&rsquo;s my new job? Well it comes as no surprise to many to say that I&rsquo;ve been a fan of a tool called ReSharper for quite some time. I&rsquo;ve been a member of the <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/devnet/academy/index.jsp">JetBrains Academy</a> for a few years and have collaborated with JetBrains at various conference booths. We&rsquo;ve now decided to formalize the relationship.
</p>

<p>
I&rsquo;m very excited to announce that as of January I will be joining <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com">JetBrains</a>. My primary role will be to help promote their products on the .NET side, which include ReSharper, dotTrace, as well as cross-platform tools such as TeamCity, YouTrack or WebIDE. As part of my job, I&rsquo;ll be doing screen casts, blogging, and not only about using the tools, but also focusing on best practices, boosting productivity, etc. As a company that firmly believes in OSS, it also means that I&rsquo;ll be increasing my participation in OSS projects and actually get to code on things I enjoy!
</p>

<p>
I&rsquo;ll be active in the community, continuing to speak at conferences and events, as well as serve as a liaison for JetBrains. I&rsquo;ll continue to blog on <a href="http://hadihariri.com">my own site</a> as well as <a href="http://devlicio.us/blogs/hadi_hariri">devlicious</a>.
</p>

<p>
As far as Twitter, we&rsquo;ll be pushing the Tool-Specific Twitter accounts for <a href="http://twitter.com/resharper">ReSharper</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/dottrace">dotTrace</a>, so make sure you follow them! You can contact me via my own <a href="http://twitter.com/hhariri">twitter feed</a>, and of course, don&rsquo;t forget Ilya, also known as <a href="http://twitter.com/orangy">Orangy</a>, ReSharper PM!
</p>

<p>
With that, all that&rsquo;s left to say is Happy New Year and we&rsquo;ll talk in 2010! And don&rsquo;t start 2010 without <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper">ReSharper</a>!
