<p>
This is the first in a series of screen casts on <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper">ReSharper</a>. I&rsquo;m still getting to grips with Camtasia as well as <a href="http://flowplayer.org">Flowplayer</a>, not to mention streaming and video formats in general, so be gentle. I&#039;d appreciate any feedback, including but not necessarily limited to Contents, Duration, Resolution, Pacing, Voice and Quality in general.

<p>
In this first screen cast I&rsquo;m going to show you some of the Localization features that come with ReSharper 5. Enjoy!

flowplayer("player", "/screencasts/flowplayer-3.1.5.swf",{
clip: {
  autoPlay: false
  // possibly more clip config
}
});
