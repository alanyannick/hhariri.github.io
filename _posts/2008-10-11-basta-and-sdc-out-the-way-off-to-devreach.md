<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color:#551a8b;text-decoration:underline;"><br /></span></p>  <p>Arrived yesterday from the <a href="http://www.sdc.nl">Software Developer Conference</a> near Amsterdam. Excellent conference and a lot of fun. They really know how to take care of speakers.</p><p><img style="border-color:initial;border-style:initial;border-width:0;" src="/blogengine/image.axd?picture=WindowsLiveWriter/SDCoutthewayofftoDevReach_FF2A/image_5.png" border="0" alt="image" width="129" height="129" /></p><p>I&#039;m heading off to <a href="http://www.devreach.com">Devreach</a> in Sofia tomorrow and then from there on to Madrid for the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/spanish/msdn/spain/eventos/alm/">ALM conference</a>. If you&#039;re going to be around in Madrid, make sure you stop at <a href="http://www.imeta.com">our booth</a>, we have some cool goodies to give away. Then I have around nine days I get to not travel before the next round of events start. </p>
