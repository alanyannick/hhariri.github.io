<p>I'll be in <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/spain/eventos/eventdetail.aspx?EventID=1032398796">Seville tomorrow</a> to talk about some of the upcoming features in Visual Studio 2010 among other topics. Then on Tuesday I'll be at Microsoft in Reading doing a 5 hour seminar on team work, project management and a whole bunch of other goodies. I'll cover topics such as:</p>  <ul>   <li>Project management using Agile techniques </li>    <li>Unit Tests, Integration Tests and Continuous Integration </li>    <li>Build Automation and Release Management </li> </ul>  <p>among other topics. </p>  <p>You can still <a href="http://www.imeta.co.uk/momentum_registration.aspx">register</a> for this event. Both events are free and the one at Reading includes coffee break and lunch! Instead of giveaways, iMeta will donate 5 pounds sterling per attendee, to a Children's Charity.</p>
