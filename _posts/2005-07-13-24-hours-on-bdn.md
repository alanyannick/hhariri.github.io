<p>Well, surprisingly my Telephone connection didn&#039;t die on me while I was online. I&#039;ll be calling the telephone company tomorrow first thing to see why!!!   <br />David, Anders, John et al, you guys have done a fantastic show. Really good. I even liked some of the music DavidI was playing, very few, but some.</p>
