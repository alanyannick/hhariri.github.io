<p><a href="http://www.sturmnet.org">Oliver Sturm</a> and <a href="http://garyshortblog.wordpress.com/">Gary Short</a>, from <a href="http://www.devexpress.com">DevExpress</a> have started a new <a href="http://www.sodthis.com">podcast</a>. Having recently met up at a conference in Germany, they decided to make me their guinea pea. Thus if you're interested in hearing two ugly guys (and myself) talk about a bunch of different things, <a href="http://www.sodthis.com/podcast/2009/03/13/the-first-sod-this-podcast-interview-wit">check it out</a>. The only thing that doesn't surprise is what they've called it. </p>  <p>It was fun guys. Thanks! </p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>(P.S.: I talk about another Podcast in it but I won't spill all the beans just yet....)</p>
