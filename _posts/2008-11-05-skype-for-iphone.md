Finally! A decent Skype client for the iPhone. I&#039;ve just downloaded it today (yes, it&#039;s free) and it seems to work great. The cool thing is that it support multiple protocols so under same interface I now have MSN too. It can also do Google Talk, ICQ, Twitter, etc. It seems (haven&#039;t investigated, only tried it quickly) that they&#039;ve disabled Skype calls over 3G (for obvious political reasons), but I&#039;m more interested in the Chat features.
