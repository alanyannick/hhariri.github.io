Did you call out on the other kids in School?

Do you call out on your colleagues at work when they screw up? Are you the one that always sends <em>that</em> email, CC'ing every supervisor, to make sure not only they know your colleague messed up, but you were attentive enough to notice?

Are you the one calling out every person doing wrong on the Internet?

In School, you'd soon be left with no friends.

At work, you'll be considered somewhat of a jerk.

On the Internet...on the Internet things are different.

But, in all cases there will be casualties.

Don't call someone out before knowing the full story, before talking to them, before reasoning with them, Â before understanding them, and before helping them understand.
