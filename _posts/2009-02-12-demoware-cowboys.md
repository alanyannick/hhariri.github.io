My mother wants to become a computer programmer (not to be taken literally). And guess what, she can. With all the RAD environments nowadays you really don&#039;t need to know much about the basics of programming to <strong>make applications</strong>. You can use anything you want. First step, pick an environment. You have lots to choose from (Visual Studio, Delphi, Ruby on Rails). In under 1 hour you&#039;ll have your first application working. Next step, sell it.
</p>

<p>
Now do this for about 10 years, making a profit and you can claim that you&#039;re successful in software development. You can claim you&#039;ve worked for 10 years and have never had to worry about things such as polymorphism, delegation, etc.
</p>

<p>
So when someone comes along with a <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001225.html">post</a> talking about weird things such as SOLID or how rules are meant to be broken, you reaffirm your position as a successful developer that has never needed or understood these concepts. And since the <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com">person</a> writing this has 1.5M visitors a month and 125K subscribers, it&#039;s OK!

(You think I&#039;m crazy. Read some of the comments on this <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001225.html">post</a>).

<strong>But It&#039;s NOT OK</strong>
</p>

<p>
I don&#039;t lose sleep over what I term demoware cowboys. Everyone has a right to make a living, however way they want. I&#039;m the first person in the room that stands up to defend not needing to graduate in CS to have a successful career in software development. However, I also defend studying, understanding and practicing software engineering, and to continuously improve yourself. Just because you sell software and put food on the table doesn&#039;t mean you&#039;ve accomplished all there is to in your field.
</p>

<p>
What does bother me however is people <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2009/01/31.html">talking</a> about things without truly understanding them. It&#039;s important to act with responsibility, specially when having so many <em>followers</em>.
</p>

<p>
Some of us write software for a living, <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001074.html">as opposed to just writing about it</a>,&nbsp; and it&#039;s not only about getting the job done.
