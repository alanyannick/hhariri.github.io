<p>I've been using Google Chrome for over a week now. What I like about it...</p>  <p>- The tab completion for search engines. Awesome</p>  <p>- The preview feature with the most recent history</p>  <p>- The history search</p>  <p>- The &quot;auto showing&quot; status bar. This is very cool. It's a really simple idea, but very cool. Think about it,&#160; why take up space for a status bar that only displays info when loading a page or displaying link information?</p>  <p>- It's FAST! I mean REALLY fast. It's instant to start up and surfing seems faster</p>  <p>- Its compatibility with the sites <strong>I visit </strong>most.</p>  <p>- Its support for saving HTTP authentication correctly. Something that Firefox nor Safari could handle properly. It can connect to Sharepoint and save credentials, which comes in very handy. With Safari I kept having to type them in despite indicating to save them. </p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>What I don't like</p>  <p>- Doesn't work with some of the sites <strong>I visit </strong>most</p>  <p>- It's lack of proper support for certain technologies like Silverlight. Sorry, if you are releasing a browser this late in the game, make sure it supports something as important as Silverlight (I'm not getting into political motivations here...I'm evaluating the browser as a TOOL in my toolbox)</p>  <p>- Zooming by pressing CTRL and the Mouse wheel works opposite to all other browsers. Forwards makes the text larger. Is this me only? A bug? Or a feature?</p>  <p>- It's lack of support for importing bookmarks from Safari</p>  <p>- Not being able to sync my bookmarks with my iPhone. Sure, this isn't Google's fault, but I'm not playing the blame game. </p>  <p>- I miss Firebug. I missed it in Safari and miss it here</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>It's the first beta. If it improves in the next release, I'll use it. If it doesn't, I'll use something else.</p>
