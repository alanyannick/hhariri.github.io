<p>
I&#039;m off to Rome next week for <a href="http://www.bastaitalia.it/">BASTA! Italia</a>, and quite excited since it&#039;s my first time in Italy. Mind you, I always say that but my trips normally involve
</p>

<p>
Airport -&gt; Hotel -&gt; Conference Venue -&gt; Hotel -&gt; Airport
</p>

<p>
And that&#039;s if the Conference is not held at the same Hotel. In this case, it is :).
</p>

<p>
Having said that, it will be good to catch up again with friends and eat my all-time favorite food (Pasta) in it&#039;s country of origin.
</p>

<p>
I&#039;ll be giving two talks which I thoroughly enjoy
</p>

<ul>

	<li>Introduction to ASP.NET MVC</li>
	<li>Introduction to jQuery</li>
</ul>

<p>

</p>

<p>
See you there!
