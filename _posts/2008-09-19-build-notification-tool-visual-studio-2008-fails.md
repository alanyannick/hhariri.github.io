<p>The Build Notification Tool for Visual Studio 2008 <a href="http://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/ViewFeedBack.aspx?FeedBackID=357244">stops working</a> if you install Visual Studio SP1. It sort of explains why it was working for everyone else except me, until they decided to update to SP1 also. </p>
