<p>Cool! I&#039;ll be going to Singapore to present a session(s). Initially it was 3, now it&#039;s down to 1, but might go up again. So if you&#039;re in the area, stop by the conference. It&#039;s going to be great.    <br />www.sda-asia.com/dotnet     <br />Other speakers there will include Chad, Michael, Terry, Neil among others...</p>
