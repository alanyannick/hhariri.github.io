I'm not a fan of tabs, and have been vocal about [their usage in our own tools](% post_url 2014-06-24-no-tabs-in-intellij-idea %}). Unfortunately with browsers there are very few alternatives when it comes to not wanting to use tabs, i.e. none.

<br/>
While I try and keep the number of tabs to a minimum, I usually have a few open pinned ones (mail, calendar, checkvist) and transitory ones. Navigating these using *CMD(Ctrl)+Number* is painful. There are many Chrome extensions that help you manage tabs, including one that numbers them when you press the *CMD(Ctrl)* key, allowing you then spend time trying to locate the tab with the corresponding number and then press that number. I've not found it particularly helpful.

<br/>
One extension however that I do find very useful is [Quick Tabs](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/quick-tabs/jnjfeinjfmenlddahdjdmgpbokiacbbb?hl=en).

It allows you to search and navigate to a tab. It's inspired by the IntelliJ platform and in fact, the default hotkey is *Cmd(Ctrl)+E* which corresponds to Recent Files. It also provides MRU functionality so you can easily toggle between the two most recent tabs by simply press *Cmd(Ctrl)+E+Enter*.

<br/>
In addition to this it has a few other useful features such as recently closed tabs, ability to search bookmarks, etc. But overall what I use it for mostly is avoiding having to use the dreaded mouse pointer to locate a tab or sit and search them using numbers.

<br/>
If you're used to working without tabs in IntelliJ, you'll probably find it useful.
