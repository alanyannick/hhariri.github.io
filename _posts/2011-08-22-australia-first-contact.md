That’s about to change. Next week, myself and Sergey Coox (<a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper">ReSharper</a> Project Manager) will be heading to the Gold Coast for TechEd Australia. We are sponsoring the event as well as having a booth present. It is going to be a great opportunity to see and talk first-hand to our users and also a personal chance to get to see (albeit very little) of Australia. We will ship a few hundred “I see dead code” T-Shirts also, so make sure to stop by the booth to pick yours up.</p> <h3>ReSharper Tips and Tricks Demo</h3> <p>We’ve managed to secure one whole hour at the Create Demo Booth that will be in the exhibit area to hold a ReSharper Tips and Tricks session, similar to those that have <a href="http://tv.jetbrains.net/videocontent/resharper-tips-and-tricks-live-session-at-ndc-2011">taken place at other conferences</a>. This will take place on <strong>Thursday 1st of September 1 pm - 2 pm</strong>. It will be somewhere in the Exhibitor area. Pass by the booth during the week for more details. </p>
