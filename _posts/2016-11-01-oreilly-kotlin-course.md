I'm happy to say that my O'Reilly course has been published and is available either directly or via Safari Online. The course is divided into two parts

* [Introduction to Kotlin ~ 5 Hours](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920052982.do)
* [Advanced Kotlin ~ 3 Hours](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920052999.do)

The material is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/hhariri/oreilly-kotlin-course).

## Target Audience

While there are comparisons and references in the course to Java, I'm more or less assuming little knowledge or background to Java/JVM. So if you're coming from
some other background such as C#, JavaScript or other, the course should still be useful to you. Or at least that was the plan. If it isn't, please, do let me know!


I'd appreciate any and all feedback.
