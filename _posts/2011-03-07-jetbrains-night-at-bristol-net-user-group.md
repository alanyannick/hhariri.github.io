<p>&nbsp;</p> <p>On the <strong>14th of March</strong> I’ll be doing a few sessions at the Bristol .NET Usergroup. It will be a talk focused on <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper">ReSharper</a> and some<a href="http://hhariri.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/image.png"><img style="border-bottom:0;border-left:0;display:inline;margin-left:0;border-top:0;margin-right:0;border-right:0;" title="image" border="0" alt="image" align="right" src="http://hhariri.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/image_thumb.png" width="207" height="116"></a> of our other tools. For ReSharper we’ll see how to use it effectively for TDD, BDD as well as following standards across teams and detecting code smells using things such as Structural Search and Replace, advanced refactoring and code navigation. The talk is going to be exclusively inside Visual Studio. I’ll also cover some aspects of Code Coverage and showing alternative solutions to tools like TFS by combining the power and simplicity of <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity">TeamCity</a> and <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/youtrack">YouTrack</a> and Open Source software. </p> <p>This is a completely free event, doors open to all and there is no registration required. The event starts at around 18:30 on 14th March. Meetings are held at:</p> <p><strong>University of the West of England (UWE) <br>Frenchay Campus, Coldharbour Lane, <br>Bristol, BS16 1QY (0117 965 6261). </strong></p> <p>We will be in room <strong>2Q49 (in Q block)</strong>. Remember, it’s the <strong>14th of March, 18:00 – 18:30</strong></p> <p>You can find directions to the university at <a href="http://www.uwe.ac.uk/aboutUWE/campus/frenchay-directions.shtml">http://www.uwe.ac.uk/aboutUWE/campus/frenchay-directions.shtml</a>. When you get to the university the guard can give you a map of the university to find Q block or you can find one at <a href="http://www.uwe.ac.uk/aboutUWE/campus/frenchay-map.shtml">http://www.uwe.ac.uk/aboutUWE/campus/frenchay-map.shtml</a>. </p> <p>Park in Car Park 1 (and remember to bring a map to get to the room).</p>
