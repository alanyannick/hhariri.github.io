On Tuesday, 5th April 2011, I'll be giving a webinar (in Spanish) on how to setup an environment with TeamCity, YouTrack and your favorite OSS tools and frameworks.

Things we'll see:
<ul>
	<li>TeamCity: Overview and benefits</li>
	<li>YouTrack: Mouseless Web Issue Tracking</li>
	<li>Introduction to Distributed Version Control Systems and benefits over Centralized</li>
	<li>Creating Continuous Integration Processes with TeamCity and OSS stacks</li>
	<li>Integration with Visual Studio and other IDE's</li>
</ul>
The webinar will be roughly 2 hours and it will be mostly demo-centric.

It is a completely free event. If you'd like to attend, please <a href="https://msevents.microsoft.com/CUI/WebCastEventDetails.aspx?EventID=1032481642&amp;EventCategory=4&amp;culture=es-AR&amp;CountryCode=AR">register here</a>
