<p>Once in a while, along comes a program or utility that really is impressive. <a href="http://www.launchy.net/">Launchy</a> is one of these. <a href="http://www.nealford.com">Neal</a>&#160; told me about it a couple of days ago when I was mentioning the cool app launcher that you can get for Mac OSX (called Quicksilver it seems). Launchy is Vista's quick launch + Google + Calculator + a whole bunch of other things like killing processes, restarting services, looking up weather info, etc. all in one. It's small and it's FAST. In fact it's faster now to look for applications than Vista. And pretty soon, unless the upcoming Vista SP doesn't fix my network problems, I'm definitely going back to XP, now having this utility. </p>
