Who was the genius that thought calling a 4.x update a “Platform Update 1” and referencing the knowledgebase would ever be a good idea? Does that person actually understand what he/she is doing?

WTF happened to calling things by Major/Minor version? As if the Client Profile wasn’t already a really stupid idea, now you come out with this crap.

Why are you messing people around like this? You realize some of us actually write software and deal with deployments?
