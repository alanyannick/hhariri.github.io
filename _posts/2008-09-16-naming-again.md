<p>I can&#039;t stress how <a href="/blogengine/post/2008/08/28/Naming-tests.aspx">important</a> naming is, in all aspects, not only tests. The first thing someone looks at when viewing code is the name, be it a class, variable or method. Naming even plays a more important role when isolating functionality. If you are following the MVP pattern to separate the view from the presenter, don&#039;t go using method names that reference any sort of visual control. Don&#039;t make a presenter method called <strong>SetActiveTab<em>. </em></strong>&nbsp;</p>  <p>It&#039;s not <em>just </em>a name. It&#039;s important. </p>
