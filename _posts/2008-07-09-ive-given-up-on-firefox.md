<p>I&#039;ve been using Firefox for a long time now...longer than I remember, and before that I was using other NON-IE browsers. Why? Because of the security issues that IE. With the appearance of Firefox and it&acute;s&nbsp; cool features, and more importantly support for plugins, it grew on me. However, I&#039;ve always had to launch IE because some sites just wouldn&#039;t work. It&#039;s not Firefox&#039;s fault, it&#039;s the site&#039;s fault. It&#039;s not designed to work with browsers other than Internet Explorer. Some of these sites I use frequently, such as online banking, and now recently Sharepoint and Microsoft Exchange Web Access. Things just don&#039;t work. </p>  <p>I&#039;ve put up with it until today. I finally uninstalled Firefox. I made the terrible mistake of installing Firefox 3.0 a couple of weeks back when it was released and I must say, I&#039;m very disappointed. Great looking skin, but in terms of stability, it&#039;s just not there. I get at least 10 crashes a day and I&#039;m just tired of it. So for now I&#039;ve gone back to IE 7 which is decent enough, and although I&#039;ll miss many of Firefox&#039;s features, at least I don&#039;t lose time or work.</p>  <p>Maybe someday...</p>
