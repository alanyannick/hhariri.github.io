<p>I&#039;ve been really impressed with Safari on my iPhone. All my favorite web sites look good and work correctly. Even Web Access to Outlook Exchange. Since I dropped Firefox a couple of weeks ago, I have been desperately looking for a replacement browser for Internet Explorer. There are many things of IE that are most annoying, specially in regard to tabbed browsing, password management and that it just doesn&#039;t seem to like the auto-type feature of KeePass. Having had success with Safari on the phone, I decided to give it a try. Wow. It&#039;s great. All the features I like of Firefox are there, but even better than Firefox, it works with Sharepoint sites (TFS) perfectly. However, for some odd reason, it won&#039;t authenticate my Web Access to Exchange...WTF???</p>
