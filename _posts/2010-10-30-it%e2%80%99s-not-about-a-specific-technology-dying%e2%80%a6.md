<h3>D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu </h3>
<p>
History repeats itself, over and over again. ASP.NET MVC came out. WebForms was dead. Entity Framework came out, Linq2Sql was dead. Now the same thing is happening with Silverlight*.
</p>
<p>
Of course, every time this happens, we&rsquo;ll immediately see reactions from those that have very high interests vested into the technology. It would be silly to think otherwise. If I&rsquo;m a company or individual that has been promoting a technology for years, what else am I going to say?
</p>
<p>
Tomorrow some other technology will be deprecated and again we&rsquo;ll see the same thing happen.
</p>
<p>
[Edited to add clarifcation] *When I talk about Silverlight in this context, I&#039;m referring to it&#039;s use for Web Development

<h3>What does dead mean?</h3>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
When it comes to technology, I think there&rsquo;s an overall consensus that dead means there will be little to no significant improvements in the technology. This means there will probably be only a few more bug fixes coming out and some minor feature here and there.
</p>
<p>
Taking this into account, what does dead mean to you?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Need the competitive edge: </strong>Building software that your business relies on to be competitive? Technology can play an important part in this.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Need to hire people:</strong> People hear about a technology dying, there&rsquo;s less incentive in learning it. This means less offers on the market. Harder to find people.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Need training:</strong> Less demand. Less offers for training.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Need to find a new job: </strong>Less demand for a dying technology.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
It&rsquo;s all a chain reaction. But every cloud has a silver lining, The market now becomes a niche. Do you know how well some Delphi and Cobol consultants are paid? If all you care about is the money, this could be a good thing too. This also doesn&#039;t necessarily imply that you need to stop what you&#039;re doing or port applications to the *next best thing*. Evaluate the situation. What are you advantages/disadvantages?

<h3>Lessons to learn&hellip;</h3>
<p>
We&rsquo;re in a profession where things move fast. Technologies, languages, frameworks come and go. If you&rsquo;ve been around long enough, you&rsquo;ll soon realize that it doesn&rsquo;t matter what language, framework or technology you use, everything has it&rsquo;s place and time.
</p>
<p>
Lessons to learn here:
</p>
<p>
- Don&rsquo;t jump on board the next hype immediately, no matter who tells you it&rsquo;s great. Nowadays people get fired even if they pick IBM.
</p>
<p>
- Don&rsquo;t limit yourself to learning just one technology or putting all your eggs in one basket. Whether you&rsquo;re a consultant, trainer or a developer or company writing software, it&rsquo;s too risky.
</p>
<p>
- Don&rsquo;t blindly follow.Open up your mind.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
And remember, it will happen again.
