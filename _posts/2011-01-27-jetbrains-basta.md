In this occasion, JetBrains, as a Special Sponsor, will be holding a JetBrains Community Night. This will be in-line with similar events we’ve recently been holding at conferences, where we show you some tips and tricks, some of the things we are working on, answer any questions you might have, and in general just spend some quality time with you, our users. We’ll top it off with snacks and beer (yes, all you can drink beer!). </p> <p>The Agenda</p> <p>- Working Effectively with <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper">ReSharper</a> for MDD (a.k.a Mouseless Driven Development) </p> <p>- Upcoming Features in ReSharper 6</p> <p>- Code Coverage with <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/dotcover">dotCover</a></p> <p>The Community Night will kick off on <strong>Tuesday 22nd of February from 7:00 pm </strong>and is open to everyone. </p> <p><strong>IMPORTANT: Whether you are attending </strong><a href="http://www.basta.net"><strong>BASTA!</strong></a><strong> or not, </strong><a href="http://jetbrains-basta-2011.eventbrite.com/"><strong>you do need to register for this event</strong></a></p> <p>I’ll also be giving two sessions at BASTA!, one on ReST with MVC (Tuesday) and another on CouchDB (Wednesday). </p> <p>Join us at <a href="http://www.basta.net">BASTA!</a></p>
