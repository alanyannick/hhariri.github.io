After a lot of messing around, I’ve managed to move my blog over to WordPress, which means I get to control Spam a little better. Unfortunately, images have not transferred over despite numerous attempts. Nor have the tags. This means that I’ll need to go through each post individually and update images, something that is dreadfully painful. I’ll get round to it gradually. Right now, up to <del>July 2010 April 2010</del> all of 2010 is done. Tagging is also still in progress....
