On Twitter there's a subtle difference between 

> "@SomePerson I think you're making a mistake with..."

and
<br/>

> ". @SomePerson I think you're making a mistake with...." 

<br/>

or the "Hey" version which is:


> "Hey @SomePerson I think you're making a mistake with..."

<br/>

In the first case, you're trying to reach out to them and tell them why you feel they're wrong and you're right. Maybe even asking for an explanation.

<br/>
In the second case, you're broadcasting your discontent with someone or some company's actions and making it really 
clear that you want the whole world to hear how they're wrong and you're right.

<br/>
The first is enabling conversations, the second is often forcing them into becoming defensive, even if that is not their intent. 


<br/>
So if someone has an issue with you, which approach
would you rather they take *first*? Talk to you or let the whole world know you're wrong before even trying to talk to you?

<br/>
Social media is a powerful platform to be heard. And when it comes to power, I'm sure we all know the saying.
