<p>&nbsp;</p> <p>A while back I posted about Zen Coding and the <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper">ReSharper</a> PowerToys, and I mentioned that we were working on providing them post Early Access Program and as OSS.</p> <p>I’m happy to announce that that day has come. <a href="http://resharperpowertoys.codeplex.com">They are hosted on CodePlex</a> using Mercurial so you can download them, play with them, fork at will and send a pull request!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;<a href="http://hhariri.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/125.png"><img style="border-bottom:0;border-left:0;display:inline;border-top:0;border-right:0;" title="1" border="0" alt="1" src="http://hhariri.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/1_thumb7.png" width="488" height="248"></a>  </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>There’s still quite a bit of work to do, including better (actual?) documentation for the ReSharper API, setting up the CI server and also making binary installs up to date with every new update. However, since all this can’t happen overnight, we’ve published the project with the bare minimum required and we’ll continue to work on it.</p>
