<p></p>  <p>I'm off to Barcelona for TechEd tomorrow. It's going to be a great opportunity to catch up with some old friends. The guys from <a href="http://www.finalbuilder.com">Finalbuilder</a> have flown over from Australia and I haven't seen Vincent and Tate for a long time. I have booth duty at the Ask the Experts stands on Tue/Wed and Thu. I'll be at the .NET Framework booths. If you're in the area, it would be great to meet up. </p>
