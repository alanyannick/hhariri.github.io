<p>We’ve only just come back from Mix 11 and are already preparing things for the next great .NET events taking place in Europe: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/belux/techdays/2011/">TechDays Belgium</a> and <a href="http://www.techdays.nl/">DevDays The Netherlands</a>. </p> <p>&nbsp;<a href="http://hhariri.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/image31.png"><img style="display:inline;border-width:0;" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://hhariri.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/image_thumb31.png" width="257" height="65"></a> <a href="http://hhariri.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/image32.png"><img style="display:inline;border-width:0;" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://hhariri.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/image_thumb32.png" width="290" height="65"></a> </p> <p>With over 3.000 delegates registered, it’s cut out to be a blast. JetBrains will be at both events, which slightly overlap. </p> <p>We will be giving away our Dead Code T-Shirts as well as some other surprise swag we have to give away. Please make sure you stop by our booths to chat. </p> <p>I’ll be doing a session at each event, a <strong>Deep Dive into MVC 3</strong> at TechDays Belgium and <strong>Real World Architectures with MVC</strong> at DevDays in The Netherlands. I’ll also be giving a short 30 minute talk at the Speaker Corner in the Expo area on the 27th of April at 12:30 on using <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper">ReSharper</a> to be more productive with Web Development. </p> <p>See you there! </p>
