<p>AppStore is now active for Spain, which is very cool. And yes, the first app I downloaded was <a href="http://themacbox.co.uk/phonesaber/">PhoneSaber</a>. My wife thinks I&#039;m a strange sad little man, waving my phone around. They&#039;ll never truly understand the power of The Force .</p>  <p>Ok, that last sentence was lame...</p>
