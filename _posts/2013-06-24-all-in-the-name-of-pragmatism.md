Knowing what a Unit Test is

Knowing what an Integration Test is

Knowing what TDD is

Knowing the advantages

Knowing the disadvantages

Knowing what you gain

Knowing what you lose


Only then, can you be Pragmatic about applying the practices and techniques.

Knowing or not knowing what DDD is,
taking a couple of <i>DDD patterns</i> and saying you're doing<em> Pragmatic DDD </em>is not Pragmatism and it's not DDD.

Knowing or not knowing what REST is,
taking a couple of<em> REST features </em>and saying you're taking a<em> Pragmatic approach to REST </em>is not Pragmatism and it's not REST, half-REST nor nearly-REST.

In the name of being <em>Pragmatic</em>, you should not redefine definitions. And what is worse, it should not be your carte blanche to mislead others. <a href="http://hadihariri.com/2012/03/18/the-journey-of-teaching/">Be responsible</a>.
