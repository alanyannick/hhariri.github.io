<p>In case you haven't heard, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;FamilyID=ee4b2e97-8a72-449a-82d2-2f720d421031">RC2 is now out</a>. Mostly it's installer changes including the ability to install MVC on servers (i.e. no VS integration). You can also download the <a href="http://aspnet.codeplex.com/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=24142">Futures assembly (Microsoft.Web.Mvc)</a> that contains add-on's that won't make it into the first release. <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/leftslipper">Eilon</a> has <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/leftslipper/archive/2009/03/03/asp-net-mvc-release-candidate-2-i-declare-myself-to-be-declarative.aspx">made a post about</a> some MVC controls that are in there. I'm not sure I'm too keen on the idea as it stands currently. Design-time support is a nice bonus, but I'm worried it's going to lead down ever more complex controls and we start to lose some of the beauty that MVC has brought back in terms of web development: nice clear separation of design, clean output and control over the HTML. The whole runat=&quot;server&quot; makes me shiver. </p>
