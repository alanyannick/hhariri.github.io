<p>While I was at TechEd in Barcelona last week, I had a chance to sit down with Mark Dunn from <a href="http://www.dotnetrocks.com/">.NET Rocks</a> and talk a little bit about ASP.NET MVC and jQuery. They've recorded the interview. You can <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/events/teched/cc676818.aspx">watch it here</a></p>
