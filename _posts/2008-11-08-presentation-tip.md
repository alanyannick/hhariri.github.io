<p>
If you&#039;re doing multiple demos that somehow involve CSS, make sure you rename the default Site.css file ASP.NET MVC creates for you. Otherwise, during a presso you&#039;ll go crazy trying to figure out why half of your demos aren&#039;t rendering correctly. In other words, make sure each demo has it&#039;s unique CSS filename so you don&#039;t run into browser cache &quot;issues&quot;.
