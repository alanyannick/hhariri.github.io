<p>So I decided to top-up my Skype credit tonight. The red 0,66 &#8364; was just making my eyes sore. Since I had some credit in PayPal, I thought I'd use that. Going through the payment process I was presented with a screen asking if I'd automatically like to have Skype charge PayPal every time my balance falls below 2 &#8364;.</p>  <p><a href="http://hadihariri.com/blogengine/image.axd?picture=WindowsLiveWriter/BuyingSkypeCredit_122C6/image_2.png"><img style="border-width:0;" height="216" alt="image" src="http://hadihariri.com/blogengine/image.axd?picture=WindowsLiveWriter/BuyingSkypeCredit_122C6/image_thumb.png" width="244" border="0" /></a> </p>  <p>Obviously I unchecked that option and proceed to &quot;Buy Now&quot;. I then got this next screen:</p>  <p><a href="http://hadihariri.com/blogengine/image.axd?picture=WindowsLiveWriter/BuyingSkypeCredit_122C6/image_6.png"><img style="border-width:0;" height="217" alt="image" src="http://hadihariri.com/blogengine/image.axd?picture=WindowsLiveWriter/BuyingSkypeCredit_122C6/image_thumb_2.png" width="244" border="0" /></a> </p>  <p>See the <strong>Always Pay with PayPal</strong>? Where did my options go? Just because I want to pay with PayPal this time I'm agreeing to always pay with PayPal? But what's even worse is the description &quot;I authorize Skype to charge my PayPal account for recurring payments&quot;. No I don't. But where's my option? Where did you ask me this? It wasn't the 2 &#8364; option was it? Even if it was I ticked no. </p>  <p>And look at the next step. I can't go back. I have to click the X icon and hope nothing happens. </p>  <p>I started using Skype back when there were somewhere around 50.000 users. There's currently 16M users online right now. Back then, you couldn't even purchase credit from Spain; they thought we all had stolen credit cards. We'll get there eventually I guess...</p>
