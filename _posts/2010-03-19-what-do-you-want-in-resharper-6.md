Although we’ve actively been listening to all requests and feedback, we’ve made it a little easier for you to have your say and vote. <a href="http://twitter.com/orangy/status/10666925316">Ilya tweeted a couple of days ago</a> about a Google Moderator that’s been setup for contributing your ReSharper 6 ideas/wishes and voting on them. </p>  <p>So if you want something in ReSharper 6, <a href="http://www.google.com/moderator/#16/e=4fb9">here’s your chance</a>!</p>
