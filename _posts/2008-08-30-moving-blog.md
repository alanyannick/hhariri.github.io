<p>I&#039;ve moved my blog to a new engine. If you&#039;re subscribed to my blog using <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/hadihariri/rSpO">Feedburner</a>, which you should be :), then nothing has changed. If you&#039;re subscribed directly, then please update your feed to use <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/hadihariri/rSpO">Feedburner</a></p>  <p>I&#039;ll gradually port all the old entries to this new engine, but for now you can find them at:</p>  <p><a href="/blogs/tech/index.aspx">Tech Blog</a></p>  <p><a href="/Blogs/Delphi/index.aspx">Delphi Blog</a> (deprecated sometime ago and merged with the previous, now this one)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you were subscribed via www.delphifeeds.com and you&#039;re still interested in my non-Delphi related stuff I suggest you subscribe to Feedburner because Delphifeeds filters posts and only allows things with certain keywords through (i.e. Delphi, CodeGear, etc.)&nbsp;</p>
