<p>Many know I&#039;ve been a <a href="http://www.finalbuilder.com">Finalbuilder</a> fan from day one. Recently they came out with a server version of their product which allowed you to run builds unattended on some machine (different from automated builds based on Windows Scheduler). However, it still lacked some of the main features demanded by a proper Continuous Integration tool. </p>  <p>Well they&#039;ve just released FB 6 along with the server version and I&#039;m really impressed. Just look at the <a href="http://tinyurl.com/5c5h8h">feature set here</a>. I&#039;m really desperate to try it out and the first thing I&#039;m going to do is create continuous builds for Intraweb. I&#039;ve been spending the past week cleaning up our build process and this will be the perfect opportunity to test out FB6. Great timing. </p>
