<p>I frequently get e-mails from people that have been at my talks about the theme I use in Visual Studio. Instead of continuing to reply individually, I&#039;ve decided to point them to this blog post from now on. As a long-time Delphi user I&#039;ve been used to the dark background (Twilight is it&#039;s name in Delphi) and find it much easier on the eyes. In Visual Studio I&#039;m using a variation of <a href="http://blog.wekeroad.com/2007/10/17/textmate-theme-for-visual-studio-take-2/">Rob Conery&#039;s theme</a> which in itself is a variation of Jon Lam&#039;s theme.</p>  <p><a href="/blogengine/image.axd?picture=WindowsLiveWriter/Designfortestability_A8D5/%7B%25URL.DOC.png"><img style="border-color:initial;border-style:initial;border-width:0;" src="/blogengine/image.axd?picture=WindowsLiveWriter/Designfortestability_A8D5/%7B%25URL.DOC_thumb.png" border="0" alt=" URL.DOC" width="244" height="146" /></a></p>  <p>My font is &quot;<a href="http://tinyurl.com/dbefe">BitStream Vera Sans Mono</a>&quot; size 11. You can download the theme from <a href="/Downloads/VSDarkThemeFontColor.zip">here</a></p>
