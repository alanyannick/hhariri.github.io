<p>&#160;</p>  <p>I never used Aero when I had Vista installed. I found it too flashy and not &quot;agile&quot;. I also had a problem due to the limitations of my graphic card, not having enough memory when plugging in my external monitor, which is a 22&quot; LCD. Since Aero uses the graphic card memory, it has limitations. In any case I think the whole Aero thing is just for show. I've used a couple of taskswitchers during XP times and wasn't too fond of any. I also purchased the StarDock pack but to be honest, it messes up your system. At least it did for me everytime I installed it. I have everything working right now and don't want to install crapware.</p>  <p>Yesterday I found <a href="http://www.ntwind.com/software/taskswitchxp.html">TaskSwitchXP</a>. It's awesome. It's lightweight (1MB memory footprint), is not bloatware and has just enough functionality. On top of that, it actually works and it's fast to work with. It has a sticky mode where you can show the list of windows and switch. Obviously it doesn't have live windows support, i.e. video showing while switching, but then again, who cares, it's a useless feature anyway. Here's a screenshot of what it looks like.</p>  <p><img alt=" URL.DOC" src="http://www.hadihariri.com/blogengine/image.axd?picture=WindowsLiveWriter/Switchingtaskswithoutthefluff_FCB8/%7B%25URL.DOC_thumb.png" /></p>
