<p>I'll be doing an Introduction to <a href="http://www.jquery.com">jQuery</a> tomorrow at <a href="http://www.malagadnug.org">our local user group</a>. It will cover a bunch of goodies including the basics, Ajax and extending jQuery. The talk will be pretty much the same in contents as the one I'll be giving at <a href="http://www.basta.net">BASTA</a> in about 2 weeks. Obviously tomorrow's is in Spanish :). There's already 25 people signed up and although there's limited space, feel free to come by even if you haven't signed up. We'll finish off the evening with a round table discussion.</p>  <p><a href="http://www.malagadnug.org/eventos/Reunion20.ES.aspx">Click here for instructions on getting there</a></p>
