<p>Only five days remaining for October Conference and we still have some space left. You can <a href="http://msevents.microsoft.com/CUI/EventDetail.aspx?EventID=1032348903&amp;Culture=es-ES">register here</a>. Since it's free, the cost of one or two days hotel + tickets still works out to like 1/3rd of the registration fee for similar events. So, why not pack your bags and head to Spain for a couple of days?</p>  <p>There will be .NET, Architecture, Delphi and more. See you all there! </p>
